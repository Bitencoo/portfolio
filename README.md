### Note

I have experience in implementing microservices in Java 21 using both REST and gRPC. These microservices were designed with a focus on scalability, performance, and maintainability, incorporating best practices such as code quality analysis with SonarQube and test coverage using Jacoco. Unfortunately, due to contractual agreements with my clients, I am unable to share the specific codebases from these projects.

Additionally, I have built applications in Flutter, leveraging Firebase services such as Firestore and Realtime Database for data storage and synchronization.

While I can't provide the specific source code for these projects, I'm happy to discuss the methodologies, design patterns, and technologies I used to achieve successful outcomes.

## üéØ Goals and Ambitions

- **Short-Term:** Improve my proficiency in Japanese and expand my experience in backend development with Go, Java and AWS.
- **Long-Term:** Relocate to Japan for professional opportunities and contribute to innovative projects that have a meaningful impact.
